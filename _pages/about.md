I am a teaching and research assistant at the [Chair of Automatic Control](https://www.ac.tf.fau.eu) of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, in the Control Software Systems Group led by Anne-Kathrin Schmuck.

I was a teaching and research assistant in the Control Systems Group of TU Berlin, where I received a PhD degree (Dr.-Ing.) advised by Prof. Jörg Raisch (group head) and Prof. Laurent Hardouin (University of Angers).

I studied Control and Automation Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. I received a master's degree in Automation Systems Engineering from the same university, advised by Prof. Max H. de Queiroz and Prof. José E. R. Cury.

My research interests lie chiefly in the area of modeling and control of discrete-event systems, particularly from the perspectives of tropical semirings and of supervisory control theory. I am also interested in the theory of formal languages, automata, and Petri nets.
