I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org), in the [Control Software Systems Group](https://cossy.mpi-sws.org) led by [Anne-Kathrin Schmuck](https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/).

Previously, I was a teaching and research assistant and a PhD candidate in the [Control Systems Group](https://www.tu.berlin/control/) of TU Berlin, advised by [Jörg Raisch](https://www.tu.berlin/control/user-jraisch) (group head) and [Laurent Hardouin](http://perso-laris.univ-angers.fr/~hardouin/) (University of Angers).

I studied Control and Automation Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. I received a master's degree in Automation Systems Engineering from the same university.

My research interests lie chiefly in the area of modeling and control of discrete-event systems, particularly from the perspectives of tropical semirings and of supervisory control theory. I am also interested in the theory of formal languages, automata, and Petri nets.
